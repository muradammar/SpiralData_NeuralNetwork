# Project: Neural Network from Scratch in Python

Out of a curiosity for neural networks and machine learning, I set
out to create my own network to gain an intuition for the underlying concepts. 
Browsing the internet I found a vast collection of videos, code, and books on neural networks.
"Neural Networks From Scratch (NNFS)" is a book that dives into the mathematics
underlying neural networks. I followed along with this book learning about networks along the way.
I also utilized multiple other resources to better understand gradient descent, optimizers
and activation functions (listed below)

***IMPORTANT NOTE: This code only trains the network. It has not yet been tested with 
test data. The goal was just to experiment with optimizers to minimize loss
